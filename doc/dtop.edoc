Starts/stops (toggles) dtop.

`Cfg' is a map. The allowed tags are `max_procs' and `sort'.

If the number of processes is larger than `max_procs', dtop will
not print any process info, just the header. This is to avoid
oveloading the VM. It defaults to 1500.

`sort' can be `msgs', `cpu', or `mem', It defaults to `cpu'.
